  "title": "Direct Detection of Dark Photon Dark Matter with the James Webb Space Telescope",
  "description": "In this study, we propose an investigation into dark photon dark matter (DPDM) within the infrared frequency band, utilizing highly sensitive infrared light detectors commonly integrated into space telescopes, such as the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST). The presence of DPDM induces electron oscillations in both the reflectors and the interior of the detectors. Consequently, these oscillating electrons can emit monochromatic electromagnetic waves with a frequency almost equivalent to the mass of DPDM. By estimating the signal generated by DPDM inside the detector and comparing with observation data, we establish constraints on the kinetic mixing between the photon and dark photon within the range [10, 500] THz. Despite JWST not being optimized for DPDM searches, our findings reveal constraints comparable to those obtained from the XENON1T experiment in the laboratory, as well as astrophysical constraints from solar emission. Additionally, we propose to modify the configuration of JWST optical elements to focus the DPDM induced signal onto the detector. By employing the stationary phase approximation, we can demonstrate that when the size of the reflector significantly exceeds the wavelength of the electromagnetic wave, the contribution to the electromagnetic wave field at a given position primarily stems from the surface unit perpendicular to the relative position vector. This simplification results in the reduction of electromagnetic wave calculations to ray optics. We show that by rearranging the position of reflectors, JWST can achieve a sensitivity stronger than the existing limits by 1 or 2 orders of magnitude.",
