  "title": "Constraints on Hidden Photon Models from Electron g-2 and Hydrogen Spectroscopy",
  "description": "The hidden photon model is one of the simplest models which can explain the anomaly of the muon anomalous magnetic moment (g-2). The experimental constraints are studied in detail, which come from the electron g-2 and the hydrogen transition frequencies. The input parameters are set carefully in order to take dark photon contributions into account and to prevent the analysis from being self-inconsistent. It is shown that the new analysis provides a constraint severer by more than one order of magnitude than the previous result.",
