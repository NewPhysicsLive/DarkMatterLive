  "title": "Constraints on Light Dark Matter Particles Interacting with Electrons from DAMIC at SNOLAB",
  "description": "We report direct-detection constraints on light dark matter particles interacting with electrons. The results are based on a method that exploits the extremely low levels of leakage current of the DAMIC detector at SNOLAB of 2-6$\\times$10$^{-22}$ A cm$^{-2}$. We evaluate the charge distribution of pixels that collect $<10~\\rm{e^-}$ for contributions beyond the leakage current that may be attributed to dark matter interactions. Constraints are placed on so-far unexplored parameter space for dark matter masses between 0.6 and 100 MeV$c^{-2}$. We also present new constraints on hidden-photon dark matter with masses in the range $1.2$-$30$ eV$c^{-2}$.",
