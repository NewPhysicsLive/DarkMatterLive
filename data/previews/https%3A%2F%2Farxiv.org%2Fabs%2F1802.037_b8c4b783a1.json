  "title": "Dark photon production through positron annihilation in beam-dump experiments",
  "description": "High energy positron annihilation is a viable mechanism to produce dark photons ($A^\\prime$). This reaction plays a significant role in beam-dump experiments using experiments using multi-GeV electron-beams on thick targets by enhancing the sensitivity to $A^\\prime$ production. The positrons produced by the electromagnetic shower can produce an $A^\\prime$ via non-resonant ($e^+ + e^- \\to Î³+ A^\\prime$) and resonant ($e^+ + e^- \\to A^\\prime$) annihilation on atomic electrons. For visible decays, the contribution of resonant annihilation results in a larger sensitivity with respect to limits derived by the commonly used $A^\\prime$-strahlung in certain kinematic regions. When included in the evaluation of the E137 beam-dump experiment reach, positron annihilation pushes the current limit on $\\varepsilon$ downwards by a factor of two in the range 33 MeV/c$^2<m_{A^\\prime}<120$ MeV/c$^2$.",
