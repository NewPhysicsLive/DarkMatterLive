  "title": "Search for $A'\\!\\to\\!μ^+μ^-$ decays",
  "description": "Searches are performed for both prompt-like and long-lived dark photons, $A'$, produced in proton-proton collisions at a center-of-mass energy of 13 TeV. These searches look for $A'\\!\\to\\!μ^+μ^-$ decays using a data sample corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 5.5/fb collected with the LHCb detector. Neither search finds evidence for a signal, and 90% confidence-level exclusion limits are placed on the $γ$-$A'$ kinetic-mixing strength. The prompt-like $A'$ search explores the mass region from near the dimuon threshold up to 70 GeV, and places the most stringent constraints to date on dark photons with $214 < m(A') \\lesssim 740$ MeV and $10.6 < m(A') \\lesssim 30$ GeV. The search for long-lived $A'\\!\\to\\!μ^+μ^-$ decays places world-leading constraints on low-mass dark photons with lifetimes $\\mathcal{O}(1)$ ps.",
