  "title": "Dark Matter at the Intensity Frontier: the new MESA electron accelerator facility",
  "description": "Dark Matter is being searched with a variety of methods, each of which tackles this challenge focusing on different kinds of particles, masses and couplings. Here we describe Dark Matter searches conducted with accelerators and fixed targets. In particular, we highlight the contribution of the experiments being built at the new Mainz Energy-recovery Superconducting Accelerator (MESA) facility. MESA will provide intense electron beams for hadron and nuclear physics, as well as for Dark Matter searches with competitive sensitivities.",
