  "title": "Constraining hidden photons via atomic force microscope measurements and the Plimpton-Lawton experiment",
  "description": "Modifications to electrodynamics from physics beyond the Standard Model can be tested to a high accuracy. Here we use two setups to place bounds on hidden photons, an Abelian boson kinetically mixed with the photon. The first setup involves atomic force microscope measurements, originally designed to study the Casimir effect at sub-$Î¼$m distances. The second setup consists of two concentric metal shells with the outer one exposed to a high voltage. By measuring the potential difference between the shells it is possible to test Coulomb's law. The limits obtained here cover regions already excluded, in particular by astrophysical observations, but provide a more direct, laboratory-based confirmation of these bounds.",
