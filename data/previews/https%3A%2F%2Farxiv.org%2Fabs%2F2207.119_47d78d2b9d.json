  "title": "Search for dark matter particle interactions with electron final states with DarkSide-50",
  "description": "We present a search for dark matter particles with sub-GeV/$c^2$ masses whose interactions have final state electrons using the DarkSide-50 experiment's (12306 $\\pm$ 184) kg d low-radioactivity liquid argon exposure. By analyzing the ionization signals, we exclude new parameter space for the dark matter-electron cross section $\\barσ_e$, the axioelectric coupling constant $g_{Ae}$, and the dark photon kinetic mixing parameter $κ$. We also set the first dark matter direct-detection constraints on the mixing angle $\\left|U_{e4}\\right|^2$ for keV sterile neutrinos.",
