  "title": "New ALPS Results on Hidden-Sector Lightweights",
  "description": "The ALPS collaboration runs a \"Light Shining through a Wall\" (LSW) experiment to search for photon oscillations into \"Weakly Interacting Sub-eV Particles\" (WISPs) often predicted by extensions of the Standard Model. The experiment is set up around a superconducting HERA dipole magnet at the site of DESY. Due to several upgrades of the experiment we are able to place limits on the probability of photon-WISP-photon conversions of a few 10^{-25}. These limits result in today's most stringent laboratory constraints on the existence of low mass axion-like particles, hidden photons and minicharged particles.",
