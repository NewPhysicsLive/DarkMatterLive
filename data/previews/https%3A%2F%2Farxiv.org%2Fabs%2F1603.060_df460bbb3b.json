  "title": "Limit on the production of a new vector boson in $\\mathrm{e^+ e^-}\\rightarrow {\\rm U}γ$, U$\\rightarrow π^+π^-$ with the KLOE experiment",
  "description": "The recent interest in a light gauge boson in the framework of an extra U(1) symmetry motivates searches in the mass range below 1 GeV.\n  We present a search for such a particle, the dark photon, in ${\\rm e^+ e^-}\\rightarrow {\\rm U}γ$, U$\\rightarrow π^+π^-$ based on 28 million $\\mathrm{e^+ e^-} \\rightarrow π^+ π^-γ$ events collected at DA$Φ$NE by the KLOE experiment. The $π^+ π^-$ production by initial-state radiation compensates for a loss of sensitivity of previous KLOE ${\\rm U} \\rightarrow \\mathrm{e^+ e^-}$, $μ^+μ^-$ searches due to the small branching ratios in the $ρ-ω$ resonance region. We found no evidence for a signal and set a limit at 90\\% CL on the mixing strength between the photon and the dark photon, $\\varepsilon^2$, in the U mass range between $527$ and $987$~MeV. Above 700 MeV this new limit is more stringent than previous ones.",
