  "title": "New Exclusion Limits on Dark Gauge Forces from Proton Bremsstrahlung in Beam-Dump Data",
  "description": "We re-analyze published proton beam dump data taken at the U70 accelerator at IHEP Serpukhov with the $ν$-calorimeter I experiment in 1989 to set mass-coupling limits for dark gauge forces. The corresponding data have been used for axion and light Higgs particle searches in Refs. \\cite{Blumlein:1990ay,Blumlein:1991xh} before. More recently, limits on dark gauge forces have been derived from this data set, considering a dark photon production from $π^0$-decay \\cite{Blumlein:2011mv}. Here we determine extended mass and coupling exclusion bounds for dark gauge bosons ranging to masses $m_{γ'}$ of 624 MeV at admixture parameters $\\varepsilon \\simeq 10^{-6}$ considering high-energy Bremsstrahlung of the $U$-boson off the initial proton beam and different detection mechanisms.",
