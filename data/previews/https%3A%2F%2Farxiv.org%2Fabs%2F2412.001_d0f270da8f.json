  "title": "Strong Constraints on Dark Photon and Scalar Dark Matter Decay from INTEGRAL and AMS-02",
  "description": "We investigate the decay of bosonic dark matter with masses between 1 MeV and 2 TeV into Standard Model final states. We specifically focus on dark photons that kinetically mix with the Standard Model, as well as scalar dark matter models that have Yukawa couplings with the Standard Model. Using INTEGRAL and AMS-02 data, we constrain the dark matter decay lifetime into final states that include photons or positrons, setting strong constraints on the dark matter lifetime that reach 10$^{25}$ s for dark matter below 10 GeV and up to 10$^{29}$ s for dark matter above 10 GeV.",
