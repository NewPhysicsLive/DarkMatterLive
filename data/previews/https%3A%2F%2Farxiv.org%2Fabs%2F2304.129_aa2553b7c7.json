  "title": "Production rates of dark photons and $Z'$ in the Sun and stellar cooling bounds",
  "description": "Light weakly interacting particles could be copiously produced in the Sun which, as a well-understood star, could provide severe constraints on such new physics. In this work, we calculate the solar production rates of light gauge bosons (e.g. dark photon) arising from various $U(1)$ extensions of the standard model. It is known that the dark photon production rate is suppressed by the dark photon mass if it is well below the plasmon mass of the medium. We show that for more general $U(1)$ gauge bosons, this suppression is absent if the couplings are not in alignment with those of the photon. We investigate a few frequently discussed $U(1)$ models including $B-L$, $L_μ-L_τ$, and $L_{e}-L_{μ(τ)}$, and derive the stellar cooling bounds for these models.",
