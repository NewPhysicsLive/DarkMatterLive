  "title": "High Intensity Kaon Experiments (HIKE) at the CERN SPS Proposal for Phases 1 and 2",
  "description": "A timely and long-term programme of kaon decay measurements at an unprecedented level of precision is presented, leveraging the capabilities of the CERN Super Proton Synchrotron (SPS). The proposed HIKE programme is firmly anchored on the experience built up studying kaon decays at the SPS over the past four decades, and includes rare processes, CP violation, dark sectors, symmetry tests and other tests of the Standard Model. The programme is based on a staged approach involving experiments with charged and neutral kaon beams, as well as operation in beam-dump mode. The various phases will rely on a common infrastructure and set of detectors.",
