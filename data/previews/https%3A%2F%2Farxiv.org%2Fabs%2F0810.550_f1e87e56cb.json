  "title": "New Constraints on Hidden Photons using Very High Energy Gamma-Rays from the Crab Nebula",
  "description": "Extensions of the standard model of particle physics, in particular those based on string theory, often predict a new U(1) gauge symmetry in a hidden sector. The corresponding gauge boson, called hidden photon, naturally interacts with the ordinary photon via gauge kinetic mixing, leading to photon - hidden photon oscillations. In this framework, one expects photon disappearance as a function of the mass of the hidden photon and the mixing angle, loosely constrained from theory. Several experiments have been carried out or are planned to constrain the mass-mixing plane.\n  In this contribution we derive new constraints on the hidden photon parameters, using very high energy gamma-rays detected from the Crab Nebula, whose broad-band spectral characteristics are well understood. The very high energy gamma-ray observations offer the possibility to provide bounds in a broad mass range at a previously unexplored energy and distance scale. Using existing data that were taken with several Cherenkov telescopes, we discuss our results in the context of current constraints and consider the possibilities of using astrophysical data to search for hidden photon signatures.",
