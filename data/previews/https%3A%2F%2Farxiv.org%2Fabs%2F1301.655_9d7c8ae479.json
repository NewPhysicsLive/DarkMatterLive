  "title": "Results of a Search for Paraphotons with Intense X-ray Beams at SPring-8",
  "description": "A search for paraphotons, or hidden U(1) gauge bosons, is performed using an intense X-ray beamline at SPring--8. \"Light Shining through a Wall\" technique is used in this search. No excess of events above background is observed. A stringent constraint is obtained on the photon--paraphoton mixing angle, $χ< 8.06\\times 10^{-5}\\ (95%\\ {\\rm C.L.})$ for $0.04\\ {\\rm eV}<m_{γ^{\\prime}} < 26\\ {\\rm keV}$.",
